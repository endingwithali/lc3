given **0b0000000011111111**

- How do we get the first 4 values? (Expected Value 0b0000)

- How do we get the last 4 values? (Expected Value 0b1111)

- How do we get the middle 4 values? (Expected Value 0b0011)

- How do we get a value at a specific index? (For index 8, Expected value 1)



The given binary value is: 0b0000000011111111

To manipulate and extract specific sets of bits from this value, you can use bitwise operations in Python or other programming languages. Here are the operations you need for each of your questions:

To get the first 4 values (Expected Value: 0b0000):
You can use a bitwise right shift operation to discard the last 4 bits:

python
Copy code
value = 0b0000000011111111
first_4 = value >> 4
The result will be 0b0000.

To get the last 4 values (Expected Value: 0b1111):
You can use a bitwise AND operation with a mask that has the last 4 bits set:

python
Copy code
value = 0b0000000011111111
last_4 = value & 0b00001111
The result will be 0b1111.

To get the middle 4 values (Expected Value: 0b0011):
You can use a combination of bitwise right shift and bitwise AND operations:

python
Copy code
value = 0b0000000011111111
middle_4 = (value >> 2) & 0b00001111
The result will be 0b0011.

To get a value at a specific index (Expected Value for index 8: 1):
You can use a bitwise AND operation with a mask that isolates the bit at the desired index:

python
Copy code
value = 0b0000000011111111
index = 8
bit_at_index = (value >> index) & 0b1
The result will be 1.

In all these cases, the operations involve bitwise shifts and logical operations to manipulate and extract specific bits from the given binary value.

- How do we get the values between two random indices?

To extract the values between two random indices from the binary value 0b0000000011111111, you'll need to use a combination of bitwise operations. Let's say you want to extract the values between index start_index (inclusive) and index end_index (exclusive). Here's how you can do it:

python
Copy code
value = 0b0000000011111111
start_index = 2
end_index = 6

# Create a mask with the desired range of bits set to 1
mask = (1 << (end_index - start_index)) - 1

# Shift the mask to align with the desired range and perform bitwise AND with the value
result = (value >> start_index) & mask
Let's break down the steps:

Calculate the number of bits in the desired range: end_index - start_index.
Create a mask by left-shifting 1 by the number of bits calculated in step 1, and then subtracting 1 to set the desired number of bits to 1. This mask will be used to extract the bits within the specified range.
Right-shift the original value by start_index to align the desired range with the least significant bits.
Perform a bitwise AND operation between the shifted value and the mask to extract the bits within the specified range.
For example, if you want to extract the values between index 2 and index 6 from the binary value 0b0000000011111111, the result will be 0b0011 (which corresponds to the value 3 in decimal).
